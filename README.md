This application uses Google's Polymer web framwork and widgets to build a single page application (SPA) that utilizes ReSTful back end services.  The services are created in Spring, and use [Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security), [Spring Session](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/), and [Spring Cloud](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-cloud).

It is based on a pair of samples by Dave Syer which you can find [here](https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular).
